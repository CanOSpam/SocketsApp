# SocketsApp

A simple Qt application that lets the user perform 4 types of tcp/ip lookups using the winsock2 api.

The lookups are: 

1. Take a user specified host name and resolve it into a IP address.
2. Take a user specified a IP address resolve it into an host name(s).
3. Take a user specified service name/protocol and resolve it into its port number.
4. Take a user specified port number/protocol and resolve it into its service name.
